# Contract Roles and Status

This document specifies the role of each top-level contract in `crynux-contracts` under the current Crynux architecture.

## Architecture Boundary

The current production architecture SHALL keep task dispatching, task assignment, task validation, and task lifecycle orchestration off-chain in Relay.

The smart contracts in current production usage MUST retain only on-chain state that Relay or node operators require for:

- node staking
- delegated staking
- bootstrap credits
- beneficial address binding

Contracts that implement the earlier fully on-chain task consensus design are retained in this repository, but they MUST NOT be treated as the active Relay integration surface.

## Active Relay Integration Set

The active on-chain contract set for Relay integration MUST be:

| Contract | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `NodeStaking.sol` | Active | Operator staking source of truth and operator-side slash execution |
| `DelegatedStaking.sol` | Active | Delegator staking source of truth, delegator share, and delegated-stake slash execution |
| `Credits.sol` | Active | Bootstrap staking credits for first-node onboarding in the testnet flow |
| `BenefitAddress.sol` | Active | Immutable payout binding for node-side balance returns and external payout systems |

Relay configuration and client initialization MUST reference only these contracts as the current blockchain integration boundary.

## Active Contract Responsibilities

### `NodeStaking.sol`

`NodeStaking.sol` MUST be the source of truth for operator-side staking. It MUST manage node operator stake amounts and staking status, enforce the minimum operator stake, support Relay-triggered unstake and slash through the configured `adminAddress`, and expose staking data for Relay synchronization. It MUST integrate with `Credits.sol` for bootstrap staking credits, `BenefitAddress.sol` for unstake payout destination, and `DelegatedStaking.sol` for delegated-stake slash coordination.

### `DelegatedStaking.sol`

`DelegatedStaking.sol` MUST be the source of truth for delegated staking and delegator share. It MUST manage delegation amounts and node-level delegator share, expose node and delegator staking views for Relay synchronization, coordinate node-level delegated staking slash when called by `NodeStaking.sol`, and clear or return delegation state when delegated staking is closed for a node. Its on-chain slash signal MUST remain node-level rather than per-delegator.

### `Credits.sol`

`Credits.sol` MUST provide bootstrap staking credits for node onboarding. In the current testnet flow, it MUST support off-chain approved credit minting for new operators, staking-only movement of credits into node staking, and unstake-only return of those credits. It MUST remain active even though it is not part of task dispatching, because Relay uses it for the credits request flow and staked credits remain slashable once moved into `NodeStaking.sol`.

### `BenefitAddress.sol`

`BenefitAddress.sol` MUST provide the immutable mapping from a node operational address to its beneficial address. It MUST remain outside task dispatching and task validation, while staying active as the payout destination source of truth for operator-side unstake returns and Relay-controlled withdrawal flows.

## Legacy Contract Stack Retained in Repository

The following contracts implement the earlier fully on-chain consensus and task dispatching design. They are retained in the repository, but they MUST NOT be treated as the active Relay integration surface.

| Contract | Legacy role | Current status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `VSSTask.sol` | On-chain task lifecycle, validation sampling, and slash trigger | Legacy |
| `Node.sol` | On-chain node registry, availability state, and legacy slash path | Legacy |
| `TaskQueue.sol` | On-chain task queue and scheduling support | Legacy |
| `QOS.sol` | On-chain QoS scoring for the legacy task path | Legacy |
| `NetworkStats.sol` | On-chain network and task statistics for the legacy task path | Legacy |
| `Random.sol` | Randomness helper for the legacy task path | Legacy |
| `CrynuxToken.sol` | Earlier token contract used by the legacy stack | Legacy |

### Legacy `VSSTask` Path

`VSSTask.sol` imports `Node.sol` and calls `node.slash(taskInfo.selectedNode)` on `TaskStatus.EndInvalidated`.

This path belongs to the earlier design in which task dispatching and validation were executed on-chain.

This path MUST be treated as obsolete for the current Relay architecture.

### Legacy Deployment Artifacts

The migration scripts and Hardhat test fixtures currently present in this repository deploy the legacy `Node` and `Task` stack.

These scripts and tests MUST be interpreted as legacy coverage for the earlier on-chain consensus design. They MUST NOT be used as the source of truth for the current Relay integration set.

## Source of Truth for Current Integration

For the current production architecture, the source of truth for contract usage MUST be:

1. the Relay blockchain contract configuration
2. the Relay blockchain client bindings
3. the active staking and delegation flows implemented around `NodeStaking.sol`, `DelegatedStaking.sol`, `Credits.sol`, and `BenefitAddress.sol`

The presence of additional contracts in this repository SHALL NOT imply active production usage.
